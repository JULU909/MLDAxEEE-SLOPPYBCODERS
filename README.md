# MLDAxEEE-SLOPPYBCODERS
Project for Rashie's Hackathon.


## About

This is a mini-project for MLDAxEEE Hackathon conducted on Oct-2022 from Nanyang Technological University.
This project has a hardware component that is primarily focused on gathering environmental data which is run
with our Machine learning models to predict Solar energy output and total energy required.

## Rationale
<br>
A vital fight any smart nation has to battle is the effective use of renewable energy while reducing tranditional
methods. Some of the largest costs in the energy industry rise from ineffective usage of storage and overproduction of power.
With our project, we can predict the required required enegy, essentially solving several issues. This also allows for the automisation
of energy production to a larger degree than today.
